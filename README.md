# Android Kotlin Project: Lost & Found

## App description
Lost & Found is a mobile app that allows people to share information about lost items they find around the world. With Lost & Found, users can easily share the name, description, and picture of the item they found. The app consists of a map where you can view all of the lost items as well as their details as markers. You can also delete these markers if you consider that you've found the lost item. There's also a tab for sharing the item's coordinates with people through other apps.

The app uses Firebase for Logging in with Google and stores data locally using Room.
